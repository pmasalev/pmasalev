## Projects 🚀

### **MyMobile**
- **Description**: Mobile application for a regional mobile network operator with 1.5 million subscribers.  
  The project involved creating a detailed **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the application, ensuring compliance with Russian Federal Law No. 152-FZ on Personal Data Protection.

  **Key Features**:
  - User authentication via SMS code.
  - Balance checking, including minutes, SMS, and data allowance.
  - Viewing current tariff plan details and switching between available plans.
  - Managing additional service options (activation/deactivation).

  **Platforms**: Android 12+, iOS 16.7.10+  
  **API Integration**: RESTful API for customer management, tariff plans, and service options.  
  **Future Enhancements**: In-app account top-up, multi-account management, support chat integration, and retail store locator.

  **Project**: [MyMobile](https://github.com/pmasalev/MyMobile)  
  **Documentation**: [SRS Document](https://github.com/pmasalev/MyMobile/blob/main/SRS%20MyMobile%20v.1.0.0.docx)

## Examples of Thematic Assignments 📑

Here are some examples of thematic assignments that demonstrate my skills and expertise:

1. **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
   - Developed detailed SRS documents, ensuring compliance with [**GOST**](https://github.com/pmasalev/examples/blob/main/GOST.md) and [**SRS**](https://github.com/pmasalev/MyMobile/blob/main/SRS%20MyMobile%20v.1.0.0.docx) standards.
   - Defined functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, use cases, and wireframes.
   - Collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements and translate them into technical specifications.

2. **System Architecture Design**
   - Designed scalable architectures for web and mobile applications.
   - Integrated RESTful APIs for customer management, billing systems, and service options.
   - Created [ER diagrams](https://github.com/pmasalev/examples/blob/main/ER.md) and [database schemas](https://github.com/pmasalev/examples/blob/main/DWH.md) for structured data storage.

3. **Business Process Optimization**
   - Analyzed and optimized business processes to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
   - Automated repetitive tasks such as balance checks, tariff changes, and service option management.
   - Implemented process improvements based on [**BPMN**](https://github.com/pmasalev/examples/blob/main/BPMN.md) modeling.

4. **Technical Documentation**
   - Wrote comprehensive technical documentation for developers, testers, and end-users.
   - Used tools like [**Swagger**](https://github.com/pmasalev/examples/blob/main/API.md) and **Postman** for API testing and documentation.
   - Created sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and API descriptions.

5. **Data Modeling**
   - Designed entity-relationship (ER) diagrams for customer, tariff, and balance data structures.
   - Developed database schemas for storing user data, service options, and transaction history.
   - Ensured data integrity and compliance with security standards.

6. **Use Cases and User Stories**
   - Developed detailed [**use cases**](https://github.com/pmasalev/examples/blob/main/UC%20%26%20UCD.md) for key functionalities such as user authentication, balance checking, and tariff management.
   - Included alternative flows and exception handling to ensure robustness.
   - Used BPMN and UML diagrams to visualize workflows and interactions.

7. **Use Case Diagrams**
   - Created [**Use Case Diagrams**](https://github.com/pmasalev/examples/blob/main/UC%20%26%20UCD.md) to visually represent interactions between users and the system.
   - Example: A diagram showing how an "Authorized User" interacts with the system to perform actions like "View Balance," "Change Tariff," and "Manage Options."
